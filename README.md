# pureVolume
video branch by Keval Parikh
We have created purevolume project in group and my part was to finish video section, So I created the motion graphic video for pure volume site.
Getting Started
I have my work done in after effects using stock images and videos.
for that project I researched some youtube videos as reference and also use my best practice in kinetic typography in the video as requirement.
