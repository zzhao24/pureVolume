# pureVolume
At first I was thinking about the framework, because the theme of purevolume is pop culture and entertainment, so the overall color of the frame makes me very upset. Later I chose to use the dark color to interpret because the dark color can make the whole website look Not so crowded, so I used the dark color to do the main page, and later the contact is also considered about this point, but the contact is different from the main page, the role of the contact is to log in the page, that is to say, our theme has been loved by customers, so I made a background that fits the popular factors. I hope that customers will like this theme website when they log in.
